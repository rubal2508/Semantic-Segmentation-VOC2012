# Semantic-Segmentation-VOC2012

I did this project in partial fulfilment of my university course "Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic". In this project we tried implementing a research paper "Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation". We trained on VOC2012 dataset and used VGG-16 architecture to create FCN-32, FCN-16, and FCN-8 models and compared the results of three of them. As all three models had around 150 million parameters each, it was not feasible to train without highend GPUs so we had to use existing weights in the end.
